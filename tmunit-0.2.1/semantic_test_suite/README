The results  of the semantic tests that  you will find in  this directory will
mostly match the results presented in the  Table 1 of [1]. However, if you run
the "perform_test" script  for the following three tests  the pass/fail report
you obtain from the execution will be reverse of what you see in Table 1.


	linearizability-violation-test
	serializability-violation-test
	single-global-lock-atomicity-violation-test	


This is just  due to the way the  tests have been designed. As  the test names
imply, the tests check whether a  consistency criterion is violated or not. If
those tests fail it means no voilation has occured and vice versa. That is why
the results in the table are reversed.
