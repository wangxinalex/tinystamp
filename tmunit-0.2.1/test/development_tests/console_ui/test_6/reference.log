tmunit -- STM Unit Testing & Evaluation Tool
--------------------------------------------

Usage:
  tmunit [options] ConfigurationFileName

Options:
  -d, --duration <int>
        Simulation duration in microseconds
  -g, --generate
        Generates a C file that corresponds to the input configuration file.
  -h, --help
        Print this message
  -s, --seed <int>
        Random Number Generator Seed (0=time-based, default=1)
  -S, --schedule <string>
        Schedule to apply on the transactions and threads. The name of
        the given schedule should be defined in the Schedules section of
        configuration file.
  -t, --threads <ThreadConfigurationList>
        <ThreadConfigurationList> is a list of the format

               ThreadDefName:Num,ThreadDefName:Num,...

        The list specifies how many threads should be created for each
        thread definition 'ThreadDefName'. The 'ThreadDefName's given in
        the list should appear as a definition in the configuration file.
        The list need not cover all the thread definitions declared in
        configuration file. The list only effects the threads definitions
        appearing in the list, while for the remaining thread definitions
        only one thread will created (which is the default for a thread
        definition).
  -v, --verbose <string>
        <string> parameter is one of the following:
             parser
             trace
             all
        With 'parser' parameter, a verbose output of input file parsing 
        will be activated.
        With 'trace' parameter, the output of a trace of all the accesses
        performed by all threads on the standart output is activated.
        With 'all' parameter, both 'parser' and 'trace' parameters will be
        activated.
