1)  The test system  in this  directory is  very naive  and unstable.  Fit the
test(s) in  this directory into a more  solid test system. Some  TODOs for the
system:

      -	Nothing is told to the user if the test fails. How should the user
	repeat the test and get the same results to debug failing test(s). 
      - The organization of the reference outputs is very poor.
      - The makefile written for the tests is very poor.

2) The test(s)  in this directory, only considers the  output generated by the
program.  I would  like to  add valgring  runs and  its reports  added  to the
test(s). Thus  the tests  should not  only report whether  it conforms  to the
reference output but also the memory related errors and leaks.

3) There is not a test for each of the files/functions in the upper directory.
