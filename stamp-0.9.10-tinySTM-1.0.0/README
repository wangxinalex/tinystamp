To run STAMP with TinySTM:

1) Download and extract STAMP-0.9.10
2) Download and extract TinySTM-1.0.0 (both in the same directory)
3) Rename the TinySTM-1.0.0 directory to TinySTM (or create a symbolic link)
4) Replace the following files in the STAMP directory with the TinySTM
   versions:
   - Defines.common.mk -> common/Defines.common.mk
   - Makefile.stm -> common/Makefile.stm
   - tm.h -> lib/tm.h
   (hint: rename the original files and use symbolic links to refer to
   new files)
5) Compile TinySTM (possibly changing compile flags)
   - "cd TinySTM-1.0.0; make"
6) Compile STAMP aplications
   - "make -f Makefile.seq" for sequential version
   - "make -f Makefile.stm" for STM version

Compilation and execution can be automated with the stamp-test.sh
script:

1) Go in the STAMP root directory
2) Run:
   <path>/stamp-test.sh <log-file> <mode> <test> <threads>...
   - <mode> is either "seq" for sequential runs or "stm" for STM runs
   - <test> is either "sim" for short runs or "real" for long runs
   - <threads> indicates the number of threads for each run

For instance:

1) Sequential runs
   stamp-test.sh out-sim.seq seq sim 1
   stamp-test.sh out-real.seq seq real 1
2) STM runs
   stamp-test.sh out-sim.stm stm sim 1 2 4 8
   stamp-test.sh out-real.stm stm real 1 2 4 8
